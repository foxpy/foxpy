### So, you have found my Github profile?

Welcome! I am a computer science student, Linux user and C programmer.

If you are my group mate and willing to get inspired by looking at my homework, most of it can be found [here](https://github.com/foxpy/homework).
The most complicated tasks subsist in separate repos:
- [error-correction-codes](https://github.com/foxpy/error-correction-codes)
- [ecc-exists](https://github.com/foxpy/ecc-exists)
- [optimal-hamming-code](https://github.com/foxpy/optimal-hamming-code)
- [inaccurate-pi](https://github.com/foxpy/inaccurate-pi)
- [battery-stats](https://github.com/foxpy/battery-stats)
- [chacha20](https://github.com/foxpy/chacha20)
- [dumb-crypto](https://github.com/foxpy/dumb-crypto)

I am also a developer of (incomplete) C [library](https://github.com/foxpy/qc) designed to help writing software in C.

I am also an author of fairly useful userspace [daemon](https://github.com/foxpy/stupid-fan) controlling thinkpad fan speed (my friend was using it).

Some day, I will start working (I swear!) on [dumbgine](https://github.com/foxpy/dumbgine), a minimalist game engine.
